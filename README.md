zTinyMCE
========

**AKA:** *Zed's TinyMCE Spin (or just Zed's TinyMCE)*

TinyMCE with some simple user-friendliness additions (custom plugins!)

Plugins' License
----------------

Zed's TinyMCE contains plugins which are differently licensed from TinyMCE itself *(the license of the bundled TinyMCE remains unchanged!)*  In short, said plugins are created by Quinn Ebert based upon existing TinyMCE code, but the changed plugin versions carry the following restrictions (to the extent permitted by applicable law):

+ The custom plugins included as-is are acknowledged to be the custom works of Quinn Ebert.
+ The custom plugins included as-is shall always be represented (in any format, modified, or unmodified) as being the work of Quinn Ebert.
+ The custom plugins included as-is may therefore be modified for your own use, but, you must ensure that acknowledgement of the original work by Quinn Ebert is always prominently displayed for yourself and any future users of your code.
+ Furthermore, you shall always present either unmodified or modified versions of the custom plugins with a prominent link to Quinn Ebert's web site, http://www.quinnebert.net/ as part of their attribution.
+ Additionally, you shall also acknowledge (wherever required) any attributions required by the author of the original TinyMCE code, in addition to the attributions to Quinn Ebert's custom code.
+ Finally, you may **NOT** profit in any way (without prior written agreement with Quinn Ebert) from the custom plugins, contact regarding potential licensing and/or re-sale agreement may be made through Quinn Ebert's contact information available via GitHub.

Custom Plugins
--------------

+ **Stupidly Basic Image Browser:** works with server-based PHP script to provide a selectable list of images (in the image tag inserter) that can be used to quickly and easily insert images without paying cash to TMCE for their paid image management plugin.
